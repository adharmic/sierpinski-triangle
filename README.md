# sierpinski-triangle
A generation of the Sierpi≈Ñksi fractal in a Java applet using the chaos game.

This program uses a Java applet, which has become mostly deprecated. The points of the triangle can be altered to other two dimensional
(or perhaps three dimensional) shapes to create fractals with more variance. The random choice should also be altered.
